How It Works

The app uses JavaScript's fetch API to make a GET request to a public joke API.
The API returns a random joke, which is then displayed on the page.
Users can click a button to generate a new joke, triggering another API call.
The UI is styled with CSS to ensure responsiveness and visual appeal across devices.

{
  "id": 123,
  "setup": "Why did the scarecrow become a motivational speaker?",
